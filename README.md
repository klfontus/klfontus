## Hi, I'm Kerstin. Nice to meet you!

I'm working on expanding my skills in computer programming and machine learning techniques. I currently work as a Data Analyst for a non-profit that serves homeless women, and have lately been working on projects dealing with population movement and neighborhood typologies.

*🎓 I'm a student in Georgia Tech's Master's in Analytics program, in the Computational Track.

*📚 My current course is Data & Visual Analytics.

*📝 My current project is creating an interactive map of clustered neighborhoods of Dallas, based on user chosen neighborhood characteristics.

*🔍 My interests include using unsupervised learning techniques to derive.

*📚 My undergraduate degree was in Mathematics and Scientific Computation, and I completed a research project titled *The Ground State Degeneracy of Two Quantum Spin Rings*.

*🌏 Fun fact about me: After getting my Bachelor's, I was supposed to teach Math in Mozambique through the Peace Corps, but was was waylaid by the COVID pandemic. I never ended up going, and decided to pursue a career in Data Analytics instead.
