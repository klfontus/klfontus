## Hello, I'm Kerstin.

I'm working on expanding my skills in computer programming and machine learning techniques. I currently work as a Data Analyst for a non-profit that serves homeless women, and have lately been working on projects dealing with population movement and neighborhood typologies.

* 🎓 I'm a student in Georgia Tech's Master's in Analytics program, in the Computational Track.

* 📚 My current course is Data & Visual Analytics.

* 📝 My current project is creating an interactive map of clustered neighborhoods of Dallas, based on user chosen neighborhood characteristics.

* 🔍 My goal for future projects is to apply more statistical analysis to my results.

* 📚 My undergraduate degree was in Mathematics and Scientific Computation, and I completed a research project titled [*The Ground State Degeneracy of Two Quantum Spin Rings*](https://mcnair.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk476/files/inline-files/The%20Ground%20State%20Degeneracy%20of%20Two%20Quantum%20Spin%20Chains.pdf).

* 🌏 Fun fact about me: After getting my Bachelor's, I was supposed to teach Math in Mozambique through the Peace Corps, but was was waylaid by the COVID-19 pandemic. I never ended up going, and decided to pursue a career in Data Analytics instead.
